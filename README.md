# Classify
Classify is an online suite of tools that allows teachers and students to make the most of their class. Teachers can use the live Q/A system and the real time sentimental analysis graphs to adapt to their students' learning needs. At the same time students can utilize the live Q/A system while the lecture is being transcribed in their native language. With the help of GE Digital we were able to make our project more efficient and scalable
